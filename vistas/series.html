                    Season 4 poses on a fluent straight forward movement of the Stranger Things franchise, with a high action gory suspense with continuous story unfolding packed with high level of detail of characters, makes it a true watch till the end.. Criticism may come for the villain known as Vecna as it felt more like he was a more Of Talk- Then Show type villain yet Vecna"s origin story feels more deadly and satisfying and a lot of plot holes feel like they need to be covered for Season 5. Praise comes for the well written Storyline and plot, CGI and mostly giving an accurate dose of blood and action simultaneously to the different monsters and even by killing some some by characters ... Season 4 will be with no doubt the darkest season from all other 3 seasons, may the Duffer Brothers continue to make more shows like this.</p></div></li>

                    This in one terrible story. Nothing new, significant is added in a Star wars saga, nothing remotely interesting. Some minor insight into Darth Vader, but other than that, the whole concept is flawed. All situations are absolutely bizzare. Every complication, all escapes, everything. Totally disappointing.</p></div></li>

                    Just finished watching the four first episodes. The pilot has to be one of greatest pilots I've ever seen. It has everything and I was hooked immideately. And it keeps getting better. I didn't know I needed this. It's really bold and a fresh wind for TV.</p></div></li>

                    Seen some of this before, but the execution was very well done.

Chris, when he's not restrained by Jurassic Park crud. Has pretty decent range of emotions for a modern actor. I'd like to see him take on some very heavy subjects that are not just action.

He could pull off a great role in the right type of indie horror film from A24 productions.

Much more respect to him after this series.

I won't go into plot, but it's Chris's show. He executive produced and obviously had a lot of say in this. Not making it politically biased like so many films are now.

Great escapism for 7hr It's shot well and the military aspects seem well researched so a squad moves tactically and they shoot properly. Not John wick style.

I think I saw 1 score votes purely for being too dark in some scenes..... adjust your tv.... far out people. Contrast and brightness are changeable....</p></div></li>
